hope - where are we?

In the weeds....
	- still going back and tinkering with base-level stuff
	- have started writing test suites,
		feels good to have done them
		don't really relish writing a bunch right now
	- getting bored with base-level stuff, wanting to do something fun
	- drifting from english syntax into more symbol-like syntax
	

What **should** we do now?
	- write docs & unit tests for everything to date
		- faster unit tester
		- write at least basic tests for each file/method
		- some sort of unit test UI
		- test on Safari
		- test in IE?
	
	- json path (or css like path) selector seems really, really handy
	- get inspector working fully
	
	- speed test thinger
		- existing tests
		- store data somewhere?
		- test try..catch blocks


What do we ***want** to do?
	- get site/app/page loader working
	- get d&d development system working
	- make at least one cool app (time tracker?)


What is working well?
	- Loader is a joy
	- Class/Mixin feels solid
	- new Template semantics are great
	- Preference and Descriptor abstraction seems pretty good


What **will** we do?
	- make tests for Tree, since we're going to base View/etc on that
	- rethink getters/setters for Element, ElementList, etc
		- eg:  'parent' could be deadly...



Decisions to make:
	- SelfSetter pattern?  
		- current implementation is slow...
		- have something like Element.data ?  with inheritance ?
		
	- List ?  also slow...  
		Subclassing Array may end up being much faster
		Can I subclass a subclass of array?

	- how to turn notify on/off quickly?
		- measure how bad it is -- function call is noop if 
		- this.observe() and this.report()
		- this.notify as flag
