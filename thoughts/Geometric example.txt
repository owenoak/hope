Do a geometric example 
	- point/line/shape
		- check api and drawable/shape/etc inheritance -- everything is drawable?
		- add exotic shapes from canvas/Shape.js  (put in single "shapes" file?)
	- hook it up to canvas
	- throw in the dynapaint tool stuff, in english


	- skip HTML for a lot of our drawing and go right to canvas ???
