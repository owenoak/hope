What keeps happening with hope
	- keep starting from trying to build a class system/loader/widget set
		- 5 serious efforts so far!
	- keep getting bogged down in the details of how to do each of the above
	- keep making base class structure incredibly complex for most folks
	- keep switching the base technology (custom, prototype, jquery)
	- keep getting bored / feeling like wrong direction / starting over again

What is constant?
	- desires to program in XML + english and have that translate into live programs
	- desire for live, bespin-like editor
	- desire for awesome templating/updating/message dict scheme
	- desire for semantic classes (closer to Prototype/Moo than jquery)
	- api of what pieces DO is pretty constant (code & approach changes)
	- desire to use what I'm creating for my clients relatively soon
	- writing in english makes me really focus what it is I'm trying to accomplish


What if:
	- start by defining all classes/concepts we'll need in XML + english
		- classes/widgets/mixins/etc
		- do gear6 statsproxy app
	- collect all the syntax and analyse for patterns
		- hopefully we have a bunch of primitives and then other things fall into a pattern
	- write a parser for the english -> JS
	- let that inform a quick set of base classes in JS - KISS!
	- write a bespin-based editor/saver
	

How?
	- will we need types for compilation?
	- 
	
What if the path so far has been perfect?
