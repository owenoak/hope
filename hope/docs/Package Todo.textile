* get pkg.loadTag("preload") working at end of hope bootstrapper
* in bootstrap packageLoaded(), check for js vs xml return and just append as script
* load stylesheets 
* load templates

h2. Think Through
* cache semantics in <script> elements (how to store?)
* @hope.getThing("package.hope")@ ?
* have registry of scripts we've loaded before?
