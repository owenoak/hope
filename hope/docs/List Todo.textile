* ListManager:
** Constructor just sets this.list and returns, so fast to set up
** All operations work in terms of array predefines so as fast as possible

* Set:
** Constructor just takes an object and returns, so fast to set up

* List:
** manages internal set of items WITHOUT being an array
** different api on top of list
** Don't mutate Array at all (or maybe just forEach())
