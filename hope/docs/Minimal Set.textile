h2. What is the minimal set of stuff we need to implement to be happy?
* utilities (extend/mixin/etc)
* ajax utilities / loader / packages
* xml parsing
* class/mixin semantics
* notification (?)
* element/element list
* drawable / canvas drawable
* some sort of templating
* message dictionary (?)


h2. Optimal class defs
* Get class/mixin/notification working
* Get Element/ElementSet working
* Get Drawable/Canvas drawable working
