h2. Canvases in Hope
* Canvases in hope are used as alternatives to drawing with HTML elements
** pie menus, graph drawing, etc

h2. Working with canvasi (do we need all of this?)
* We treat Canvas drawables and HTML drawables interchangeably
** Canvas drawables can have children (which MUST BE canvases)
** HTML drawables can have children which can be canvases
** We do hit detection in children automatically
p.
* We add methods to Canvas to make them easier to work with:
** all element methods apply to canvas (see: "Element-ElementList":# )
** rotate(), scale(), translate(), zoom()
** path drawing (w/ SVG paths)
** 'crisp' lines, offset 1/2 pixel to draw more cleanly
** center point for rotation/translation
** fill() / stroke() / erase() / mask() paths
** placing images in the canvas / pulling images from the canvas


h3. Canvas Styles
* We define 'canvas styles', analagous to css styles:
* We parse styles (either directly or from CSS) and create an optimized function to draw in that style
* Styles are cached
* You will typically pre-define a number of styles, then use them in your objects, for efficiency
